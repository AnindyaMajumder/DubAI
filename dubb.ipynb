    "# DubAI: Automated Video Dubbing System\n",
    "\n",
    "DubAI is a comprehensive solution for creating dubbed versions of YouTube videos in different languages. By leveraging advanced AI models for transcription, translation, and text-to-speech synthesis, this project automates the process of video dubbing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "DubAI takes a YouTube video link and a target language as input, processes the video to extract audio, transcribes the speech, translates it into the desired language, and generates a dubbed version of the video. This project is particularly useful for content creators, educators, and businesses aiming to reach a global audience by providing multilingual video content."
